# Open Intelligent Multimedia Analysis for Java (OpenIMAJ)

OpenIMAJ is an award-winning set of libraries and tools for multimedia (images, text, video, audio, etc.) content analysis and content generation. OpenIMAJ is very broad and contains everything from state-of-the-art computer vision (e.g. SIFT descriptors, salient region detection, face detection, etc.) and advanced data clustering, through to software that performs analysis on the content, layout and structure of webpages.

## How to use OpenIMAJ

Please see the tutorial: http://openimaj.org/tutorial

## Compiling OpenIMAJ from source

Instructions for source compilation can be found here: https://github.com/openimaj/openimaj/wiki/Compiling-OpenIMAJ-from-Source
Please note that you probably don't want to do this unless you intend on adding new features or making changes to the source code; precompiled jars of release versions are available from Maven Central, and regular snapshots (built automatically on when code is pushed to the github repository) are available from http://snapshots.openimaj.org
